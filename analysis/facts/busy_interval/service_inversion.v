      is bounded by cumulative priority inversion. *)
  Section PriorityInversion.

    (** Consider a reflexive JLFP policy.

        Note that, unlike the other sections, this section assumes a
        JLFP policy. This is due to the fact that priority inversion
        is defined in terms of JLFP policies. This is not a
        fundamental assumption and may be relaxed in the future. *)

    (** ... and, as a corollary, it is easy to see that cumulative
        service inversion is bounded by cumulative priority
        inversion. *)
