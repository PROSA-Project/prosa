# Directory with composite hypotheses

This directory contains composite hypotheses that combine multiple simpler assumptions from other parts of the model library into commonsense definitions that are frequently used in the literature.

- If it is the tenth time you find yourself stating the same combination of hypotheses, consider creating a new composite hypothesis here.
- Note: composite hypotheses should only be created if the combination of assumptions is intuitively meaningful and frequently used.
