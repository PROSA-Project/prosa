## Note on the Instantiations of RTAs for the Periodic Resource Model

The current instantiations of PRM RTAs are based on instantiating the aRSA.
This approach is retained mostly due to historical reasons and to maintain consistency with other concrete RTAs.
In the future, it may be preferable to instantiate PRM RTAs from the concrete RTAs for restricted supply,
as these already employ generic SBFs and provide a more direct foundation.
