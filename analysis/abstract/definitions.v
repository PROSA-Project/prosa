(** * Definitions for Abstract Response-Time Analysis *)

(** In the following, we propose a set of definitions for the general
    framework for response-time analysis (RTA) of uni-processor
    scheduling of real-time tasks with arbitrary arrival models. *)

(** We are going to introduce two main variables of the analysis:
    (a) interference, and (b) interfering workload. *)

(** ** a) Interference *)
(** Execution of a job may be postponed by the environment and/or the
    system due to different factors (preemption by higher-priority
    jobs, jitter, black-out periods in hierarchical scheduling, lack
    of budget, etc.), which we call interference.

    Besides, note that even the subsequent activation of a task can
    suffer from interference at the beginning of its busy interval
    (despite the fact that this job hasnâ€™t even arrived at that
    moment!). Thus, it makes more sense (at least for the current
    busy-interval analysis) to think about interference of a job as
    any interference within the corresponding busy interval, and not
    just after the release of the job.

    Based on that rationale, assume a predicate that expresses whether a job [j]
    under consideration incurs interference at a given time [t] (in
    the context of the schedule under consideration).  This will be
    used later to upper-bound job [j]'s response time. Note that a
    concrete realization of the function may depend on the schedule,
    but here we do not require this for the sake of simplicity and
    generality. *)
Class Interference (Job : JobType) :=
  interference : Job -> instant -> bool.

(** ** b) Interfering Workload *)
(** In addition to interference, the analysis assumes that at any time
    [t], we know an upper bound on the potential cumulative
    interference that can be incurred in the future by any job (i.e.,
    the total remaining potential delays). Based on that, assume a
    function [interfering_workload] that indicates for any job [j], at
    any time [t], the amount of potential interference for job [j]
    that is introduced into the system at time [t]. This function will
    be later used to upper-bound the length of the busy window of a
    job.  One example of workload function is the "total cost of jobs
    that arrive at time [t] and have higher-or-equal priority than job
    [j]". In some task models, this function expresses the amount of the
    potential interference on job [j] that "arrives" in the system at
    time [t]. *)
Class InterferingWorkload (Job : JobType) :=
  interfering_workload : Job -> instant -> duration.

(** Next we introduce all the abstract notions required by the analysis. *)
Section AbstractRTADefinitions.

  (** Consider any type of job associated with any type of tasks... *)
  Context {Job : JobType}.
  Context {Task : TaskType}.
  Context `{JobTask Job Task}.

  (** ... with arrival times and costs. *)
  Context `{JobArrival Job}.
  Context `{JobCost Job}.

  (** Consider any kind of processor state model. *)
  Context {PState : ProcessorState Job}.

  (** Consider any arrival sequence ... *)
  Variable arr_seq : arrival_sequence Job.

  (** ... and any schedule of this arrival sequence. *)
  Variable sched : schedule PState.

  (** Let [tsk] be any task that is to be analyzed *)
  Variable tsk : Task.

  (** Assume we are provided with abstract functions for interference
      and interfering workload. *)
  Context `{Interference Job}.
  Context `{InterferingWorkload Job}.

  (** In order to perform subsequent abstract Response Time Analyses
      (RTAs), it is essential that we have the capability to bound
      interference of a certain type (for example, interference that
      comes from other tasks' jobs). To achieve this, we define
      "conditional" interference as a conjunction of a predicate [P :
      Job -> instant -> bool] encoding the property of interest and
      [interference]. *)
  Definition cond_interference P j t :=
    (P j t) && (interference j t).

  (** In order to bound the response time of a job, we must consider
      (1) the cumulative conditional interference, ... *)
  Definition cumul_cond_interference P j t1 t2 :=
    \sum_(t1 <= t < t2) cond_interference P j t.

  (**  ... (2) cumulative interference, ... *)
  Definition cumulative_interference j t1 t2 :=
    cumul_cond_interference (fun _ _ => true) j t1 t2.

  (** ... and (3) cumulative interfering workload. *)
  Definition cumulative_interfering_workload j t1 t2 :=
    \sum_(t1 <= t < t2) interfering_workload j t.

  (** Next, we introduce a notion of absence of speculative
      execution. This notion is _not_ directly related to Abstract
      RTA, but it is useful when proving the existence of bounded busy
      intervals.

      We say that the functions [Interference] and
      [InterferingWorkload] do not allow speculative execution if the
      cumulative interference never exceeds the cumulative interfering
      workload. Intuitively, one can interpret this definition as
      stating that it is not allowed to perform work before it is
      known whether it is actually needed (i.e., before the work
      appears as actual workload). *)
  Definition no_speculative_execution :=
    forall j t,
      cumulative_interference j 0 t <= cumulative_interfering_workload j 0 t.

  (** ** Definition of Busy Interval *)
  (** Further analysis will be based on the notion of a busy
      interval. The overall idea of the busy interval is to take into
      account the workload that cause a job under consideration to
      incur interference. In this section, we provide a definition of
      an abstract busy interval. *)

  (** We say that time instant [t] is a quiet time for job [j] iff
      two conditions hold. First, the cumulative interference at
      time [t] must be equal to the cumulative interfering
      workload. Intuitively, this condition indicates that the
      potential interference seen so far has been fully "consumed"
      (i.e., there is no more higher-priority work or other kinds of
      delay pending). Second, job [j] cannot be pending at any time
      earlier than [t] _and_ at time instant [t] (i.e., either it
      was pending earlier but is no longer pending now, or it was
      previously not pending and may or may not be released
      now). The second condition ensures that the busy window
      captures the execution of job [j]. *)
  Definition quiet_time (j : Job) (t : instant) :=
    (cumulative_interference j 0 t == cumulative_interfering_workload j 0 t)
    && ~~ pending_earlier_and_at sched j t.

  (** Based on the definition of quiet time, we say that an interval
      <<[t1, t2)>> is a (potentially unbounded) busy-interval prefix
      w.r.t. job [j] iff the interval (a) contains the arrival of
      job j, (b) starts with a quiet time and (c) remains
      non-quiet. *)
  Definition busy_interval_prefix (j : Job) (t1 t2 : instant) :=
    t1 <= job_arrival j < t2
    /\ quiet_time j t1
    /\ (forall t, t1 < t < t2 -> ~ quiet_time j t).

  (** Next, we say that an interval <<[t1, t2)>> is a busy interval
      iff <<[t1, t2)>> is a busy-interval prefix and [t2] is a quiet
      time. *)
  Definition busy_interval (j : Job) (t1 t2 : instant) :=
    busy_interval_prefix j t1 t2
    /\ quiet_time j t2.

  (** Note that the busy interval, if it exists, is unique. *)

  (** In this section, we introduce some assumptions about the busy
      interval that are fundamental to the analysis. *)
  Section BusyIntervalProperties.

    (** We say that a schedule is "work-conserving" (in the abstract
        sense) iff, for any job [j] from task [tsk] and at any time [t]
        within a busy interval, there are only two options: either (a)
        [interference(j, t)] holds or (b) job [j] is scheduled at time
        [t]. *)
    Definition work_conserving :=
      forall j t1 t2 t,
        arrives_in arr_seq j ->
        job_cost j > 0 ->
        busy_interval_prefix j t1 t2 ->
        t1 <= t < t2 ->
        ~ interference j t <-> receives_service_at sched j t.

    (** Next, we say that busy intervals of task [tsk] are bounded by
        [L] iff, for any job [j] of task [tsk], there exists a busy
        interval with length at most [L]. Note that the existence of
        such a bounded busy interval is not guaranteed if the schedule
        is overloaded with work.  Therefore, in the later concrete
        analyses, we will have to introduce an additional condition
        that prevents overload. *)
    Definition busy_intervals_are_bounded_by L :=
      forall j,
        arrives_in arr_seq j ->
        job_of_task tsk j ->
        job_cost j > 0 ->
        exists t1 t2,
          t1 <= job_arrival j < t2
          /\ t2 <= t1 + L
          /\ busy_interval j t1 t2.

    (** Although we have defined the notion of cumulative
        (conditional) interference of a job, it cannot be used in a
        (static) response-time analysis because of the dynamic
        variability of job parameters. To address this issue, we
        define the notion of an interference bound. *)

    (** As a first step, we introduce a notion of an "interference
        bound function" [IBF]. An interference bound function is any
        function with a type [duration -> duration -> work] that bounds
        cumulative conditional interference of a job of task [tsk] (a
        precise definition will be presented below).

        Note that the function has two parameters. The second
        parameter is the length of an interval in which the
        interference is supposed to be bounded. It is quite intuitive;
        so, we will not explain it in more detail. However, the first
        parameter deserves more thoughtful explanation, which we
        provide next. *)
    Variable IBF : duration -> duration -> work.

    (** The first parameter of [IBF] allows one to organize a case
        analysis over a set of values that are known only during the
        computation. For example, the most common parameter is the
        relative arrival time [A] of a job (of a task under
        analysis). Strictly speaking, [A] is not known when computing
        a fixpoint; however, one can consider a set of [A] that covers
        all the relevant cases. There can be other valid properties
        such as "a time instant when a job under analysis has received
        enough service to become non-preemptive."

        To make the first parameter customizable, we introduce a
        predicate [ParamSem : Job -> instant -> Prop] that is used to
        assign meaning to the second parameter. More precisely,
        consider an expression [IBF(X, delta)], and assume that we
        instantiated [ParamSem] as some predicate [P]. Then, it is
        assumed that [IBF(X, delta)] bounds (conditional) interference
        of a job under analysis [j âˆˆ tsk] if [P j X] holds. *)
    Variable ParamSem : Job -> nat -> Prop.

    (** As mentioned, [IBF] must upper-bound the cumulative
        _conditional_ interference. This is done to make further
        extensions of the base aRTA easier. The most general aRTA
        assumes that an IBF bounds _all_ interference of a given job
        [j]. However, as we refine the model under analysis, we split
        the IBF into more and more parts. For example, assuming that
        tasks are sequential, it is possible to split IBF into two
        parts: (1) the part that upper-bounds the cumulative
        interference due to self-interference and (2) the part that
        upper-bounds the cumulative interference due to all other
        reasons. To avoid duplication, we parameterize the definition
        of an IBF by a predicate that encodes the type of interference
        that must be upper-bounded. *)
    Variable Cond : Job -> instant -> bool.

    (** Next, let us define this reasoning formally. We say that the
        conditional interference is bounded by an "interference bound
        function" [IBF] iff for any job [j] of task [tsk] and its busy
        interval <<[t1, t2)>> the cumulative conditional interference
        incurred by [j] w.r.t. predicate [Cond] in the sub-interval
        <<[t1, t1 + Î”)>> does not exceed [IBF(X, Î”)], where [X] is a
        constant that satisfies a predefined predicate [ParamSem].

        In other words, for a job [j âˆˆ tsk], the term [IBF(X, Î”)]
        provides an upper-bound on the cumulative conditional
        interference (w.r.t. the predicate [Cond]) that [j] might
        experience in an interval of length [Î”] _assuming_ that
        [ParamSem j X] holds. *)
    Definition cond_interference_is_bounded_by :=
      (** Consider a job [j] of task [tsk], a busy interval <<[t1, t2)>>
          of [j], and an arbitrary interval <<[t1, t1 + Î”) âŠ† [t1, t2)>>. *)
      forall t1 t2 Î” j,
        arrives_in arr_seq j ->
        job_of_task tsk j ->
        busy_interval j t1 t2 ->
        (** We require the IBF to bound the interference only within
           the interval <<[t1, t1 + Î”)>>. *)
        t1 + Î” < t2 ->
        (** Next, we require the [IBF] to bound the interference only
            until the job is completed, after which the function can
            behave arbitrarily. *)
        ~~ completed_by sched j (t1 + Î”) ->
        (** And finally, the IBF function might depend not only on the
            length of the interval, but also on a constant [X]
            satisfying predicate [Param]. *)
        forall X,
          ParamSem j X ->
          cumul_cond_interference Cond j t1 (t1 + Î”) <= IBF X Î”.

  End BusyIntervalProperties.

      is (unconditionally) bounded by [IBF] if it is conditionally
      bounded with [Cond := fun j t => true]. *)
