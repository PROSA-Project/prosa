The behavior directory/module collects all definitions and theories about system behavior (i.e., trace-based semantics).

Any aspects related to system *modeling* (e.g., sporadic tasks, arrival curves, etc.) do *not* belong here and should go into the *model* directory/module instead. 

This is a work-in-progress directory and part of the larger Prosa restructuring effort. As parts in Prosa a changed to comply with the “new style”, they are placed here.
