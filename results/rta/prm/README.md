## Note on the Instantiations of RTAs for the Periodic Resource Model

The current instantiations of the RTAs for the periodic resource model are based on instantiating aRSA directly.
This approach is retained mostly due to historical reasons and to maintain consistency with other concrete RTAs.
In the future, it may be preferable to instantiate RTAs for the periodic resource model from the concrete RTAs for restricted supply,
as these already employ generic SBFs and provide a more direct foundation.
