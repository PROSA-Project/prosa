(** In this file, we prove a bound on the total blackout time (i.e.,
    time during which no job makes progress due to overheads),
    assuming a given number of schedule changes. *)
Section TotalBlackoutDueToOverheadsBounded.

  (** Consider any type of jobs. *)
  Context {Job : JobType}.
  Context `{JobArrival Job}.
  Context `{JobCost Job}.

  (** Consider a JLFP-policy that indicates a higher-or-equal priority
      relation, and assume that this relation is reflexive and
      transitive. *)
  Context {JLFP : JLFP_policy Job}.
  Hypothesis H_priority_is_reflexive : reflexive_job_priorities JLFP.
  Hypothesis H_priority_is_transitive : transitive_job_priorities JLFP.

  (** Consider any valid arrival sequence, ... *)
  Variable arr_seq : arrival_sequence Job.
  Hypothesis H_valid_arrival_sequence : valid_arrival_sequence arr_seq.

  (** ... and any schedule of this arrival sequence... *)
  Variable sched : schedule (overheads.processor_state Job).

  (** ... where jobs do not execute before their arrival nor after completion. *)
  Hypothesis H_jobs_come_from_arrival_sequence : jobs_come_from_arrival_sequence sched arr_seq.
  Hypothesis H_jobs_must_arrive_to_execute : jobs_must_arrive_to_execute sched.

  (** Finally, we assume that the schedule respects a valid overhead
      resource model with dispatch overhead [DB], context switch
      overhead [CSB], and preemption-related overhead [CRPDB]. *)
  Variable DB CSB CRPDB : duration.
  Hypothesis H_valid_overheads_model :
    overhead_resource_model sched DB CSB CRPDB.

  (** The total blackout duration in the interval <<[t1, t2)>> can be
      decomposed into time spent in dispatching, context switching,
      and CRPD (cache-related preemption delay). *)
