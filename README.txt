SCHEDULE


- In the proofs, we are interested in
	 			Every possible schedule of SOMETHING (tasks, jobs)
- In a schedule, there is an initial set of jobs or tasks. Tasks create new jobs every period.
- We need to be able to argue about the timeliness of every job generated in this schedule

SCHEDULE PROGRESSION

- A schedule corresponds to an infinite sequence of execution.
- 

RESTRICTING SCHEDULE

- Time windows
- We should be able to analyze an interval of a schedule

Time window starting at t.
	exists a valid schedule until t (assumption?)


- Jobs don't repeat
- A schedule
